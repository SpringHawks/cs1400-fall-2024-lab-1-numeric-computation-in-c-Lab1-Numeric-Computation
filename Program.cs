// Pie Code

double radius = 2.50;
double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;

Console.WriteLine(area);

//Write code that calculates the area of a circle whose radius is 2.50 centimeters.
//Remember that the area of a circle is the radius squared multiplied by PI. 
//One hint: .NET contains a constant for PI, Math.PI that you can use for that value. 
//Math.PI, like all constants declared in the System.Math namespace, is a double value.
//For that reason, you should use double instead of decimal values for this challenge.
